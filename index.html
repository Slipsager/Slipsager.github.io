  <p>We are playing around with github</p>
  <p>If you don't already know, GitHub is an incredibly effective way to collaborate on development projects. Providing a place for anyone with an internet connection to have an avenue where they can share code with the world for free (not to mention the robust supporting tools for source inspection and easy viewing of commit histories). GitHub has been adopted by many large open-source projects as their primary home for collaboration and contribution.
